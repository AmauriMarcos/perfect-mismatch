          Hi, I'm Marija! I'm living in Serbia with my wonderful
          familyâ€”my husband and our three energetic kids. I have a sweet tooth
          and love trying new desserts, singing, and spending time with friends
          and loved ones. Family means everything to me, and we enjoy creating
          special moments together. This space is where I share my passion for
          life, family, and all the little things that make every day special.
